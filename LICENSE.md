# signedBarterPromise License

if you profited more through me than a half hour of your while is worth to you, than give me a promise for a half hour of your time for some brainwork.

my demand:
    i value the laser-activity project described in my github repos
    i value the postcashcash project which is not described here at all, because i thought it would challange the theft by the government and i am gay and afraid of death, but i realised that it will not be better than bitcoin because of the price problem which fiat brings with. so it provides that little value, that government can continue robbing and i will not execute me for publishing this idea and leaving trails which lead to my real identity..., so you will maybe see a concept description of postcashcash here in my repos...

so you just invest a half hour of your time in a project of mine or you sign a claim of a half hour of your work and provide two lists: your demands, your services. i pay also for the time writing the lists..
