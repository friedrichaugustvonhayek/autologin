if your privacy is less worth to you than your time, than you can reject installing your own instance and just use mine, if its still online (i will move to a different server after 2025 and will not care about this project if you don't pay enough and i will not advertise so you will most likely be screwed if you use my service. but the domain is/was once: https://autologin.lernplattform.madhacker.biz

# installation

check out install_all.sh

Hi folks,

2do and quickstart

hope you kinda get what needs to get done til this stuff runs, cause a little adjustments need to get made if you haven't admin rights or you run in a jailed home or whatever...

make a docker container und push it please

also make a instance directory to choose between servers...

and i am using a free domain which will deactivate after 6 months and i will not care because you are not paying me enough, so here is the code build something with it...

ohhh and you might want to ask yourself which part of that code is the heart of the miracle which does the magic...
its start_zeiterfassung(credentials) in parallelInteractions.py. credentials is a dictionary with (trying to remember...)the keys 'username' and 'password' or shit (i don't look that now up, as you don't pay)

and if you deploy an instance of my code then you owe me a half hour of help. mail to me "fahayek@postcashcash.com" but my mailserver gets rejected by some mailers because of dns shit i didn't invest in to configure ... maybe just mail to jhv83f27yhsdhfkwl3hgsadfg@proton.me. check out LICENCE.md for details
