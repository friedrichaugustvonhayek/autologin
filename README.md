# installation

check out install_all.sh

Hi folks,

2do and quickstart

hope you kinda get what needs to get done til this stuff runs, cause a little adjustments need to get made if you haven't admin rights or you run in a jailed home or whatever...
make a docker container und push it please
also make a instance directory to choose between servers...
and i am using a free domain which will deactivate after 6 months and i will not care because you are not paying me enough, so here is the code build something with it...
ohhh and you might want to ask yourself which part of that code is the heart of the miracle which does the magic...
its start_zeiterfassung(credentials) in parallelInteractions.py. credentials is a dictionary with (trying to remember...)the keys 'username' and 'password' or shit (i don't look that now up, as you don't pay)
and if you deploy an instance of my code then you owe me a half hour of help. mail to me "fahayek@postcashcash.com" but my mailserver gets rejected by some mailers because of dns shit i didn't invest in to configure ... maybe just mail to jhv83f27yhsdhfkwl3hgsadfg@proton.me

Laissez-faire - fahayek
